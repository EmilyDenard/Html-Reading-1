    <h1>Questions for Class</h1>

    <h2>What does the br tag do?</h2>
    <p>It creates a line break in text without making a new paragraph.</p>
    <h2>What is a "self closing tag"?</h2>
    <p>
      Self closing tags are empty tags, they have no content and no closing tag.
    </p>
    <h2>What does the strong tag do.</h2>
    <p>It defines texts as important and also makes the text bold.</p>
    <h2>Where will you find the DOCTYPE tag? What is it used for?</h2>
    <p>
      You will find the tag at the top of the page only once. The tag is used
      for displaying web pages correctly.
    </p>
    <h2>
      A link is defined with an a tag. What does the href attribute specify?
    </h2>
    <p>The links destination.</p>
    <h2>
      Explain the concept of a "nested element" to someone with a non-tech
      background.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nested elements are elements that are able to have other elements between
      the open and closing tags.
    </p>
    <h2>Why is it a bad idea to skip the end tag (or closing tag)?</h2>
    <p>
      Most of the time the elements will display wrong but with some tags it
      will display correctly.
    </p>
    <h2>
      An image is defined with the img tag. What attributes can be provided to
      this tag, and what are their functions?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed. The
      required alt attribute specifies an alternate text for the image.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Browse the W3 schools website there is a list to the left of the page for
      a new tag that you have not seen yet. Explain what the tag does, and why
      you would use it.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The detail tag is a tag I have not seen but it defines additional details
      that the user can view or hide. I think I would use this tag if I am
      creating a website and there are things people want a little more
      information on. It could be helpful to have because you can see it or hide
      it.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What is something more you would like to learn about HTML in general, or
      about particular topic, specifically?
    </h2>
    <p>
      I want to learn how to create graphs and how to make buttons work. I have
      learned how to put a chart and how to put a button on a page but I haven't
      learned how to make it work to take you to another page. I think there are
      a lot of things I want to learn and those are the two I thought of first.
